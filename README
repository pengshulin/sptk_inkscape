Shulin Peng's ToolKit for inkscape extensions
(short for SPTK)

This is my personal Inkscape/UI design toolkit.  It's used to prototype 
my segment LCD screen layout when new project begins.  This increases my 
work efficiency (I'm designing portable handheld instruments with LCD).

Current features:
*) Set selected segment ON/OFF;
*) Toggle selected segment ON/OFF;
*) Snapshot/Load segments ON/OFF states and management them;

NOTE:
*) ON/OFF is controlled with opacity which can be modified manually.

If any bug is found, feel free to mail me <trees_peng@163.com>.
